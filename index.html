    <h4>Cities I've lived in:</h4>
    <p>I came to live in Denver because my family moved here
        when I was a kid. I then moved to San Francisco in middle school.
        I was living in Rota while in the Navy, and then upon getting out,
        I moved to Austin with a buddy of mine from college.
        Finally, I lived in Brooklyn for 2 years while I was working 
        for a company called 'Daily Burn'.

    <h4>Cities that I'd like to visit:</h4>
    <p>I'd love to visit London for the history, and the accessibility.
        Tokyo would be fun because its a different culture.
        And Buenos Aries would great because I've never been to South America,
        and it looks beautiful.
